# Question 3 --------------------------------------------------------------

print("In both R and Python, it is easy to create vectors and matrices. However, it is a little bit easier in R as its not necessary to rely on external libraries like NumPy. Additionally, the syntax in R and Python is slightly different such that R is more compact where it can create vectors and matrices easier such as creating the vector through 'vec <- 1:50'. Additionally, it is easier to go about doing statistics on the dataframes and matrices in R as we dont need external libraries like NumPy and Pandas. However, I think python is a little easier to interpret and is easier to read becuase it is not so compact. For example, loops in R can begin to seem a little messy while loops in Python appear cleaner. Overall, for tasks like the ones in this assignment, I prefer R as it is easier to go about manipulating dataframes and matrices as well as doing statistics on them. However, I like python as it has more capabilities like machine learning.")
